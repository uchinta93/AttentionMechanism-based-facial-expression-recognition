Overview

This repository includes three Jupyter Notebooks, each applying different techniques for facial emotion recognition using CK+, FER2013, and Raf-DB datasets. These projects utilize advanced machine learning and deep learning methodologies to classify emotions from facial expressions.

Projects

1. CK+ Classification
Notebook: Ck+ classification (1).ipynb
Description: This notebook focuses on emotion classification using the CK+ dataset.
Techniques Used: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from facial images, data augmentation to increase dataset diversity, and various classification algorithms for emotion prediction.
2. FER2013 Classification
Notebook: FER2013 classificaiton.ipynb
Description: This project involves emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset, a standard benchmark in the field.
Techniques Used: Utilization of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, implementation of CNN models for effective feature learning, and application of transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models.
3. Raf-DB Classification
Notebook: Raf-db 1 (1).ipynb
Description: A study on emotion classification using the Raf-DB dataset, characterized by its real-world facial expression images.
Techniques Used: Advanced CNN architectures for deep feature extraction, sophisticated data preprocessing and normalization methods, and ensemble learning methods for improved classification accuracy.
